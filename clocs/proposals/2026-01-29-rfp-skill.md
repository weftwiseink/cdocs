# RFP Skill

> BLUF(mjr/clocs/rfp): A `/cloc:rfp` skill that scaffolds lightweight `request_for_proposal` stubs: a topic and enough context for a future author to elaborate into a full proposal.
> Sits below `/cloc:propose` in effort: captures intent and scope without requiring full design work.

## Objective

Creating RFP stubs currently requires manual knowledge of frontmatter fields, proposal template structure, and the `request_for_proposal` status value.
A dedicated skill would let users quickly capture proposal ideas with consistent structure, lowering the barrier to seeding the proposal pipeline.

## Scope

This proposal should explore:

- The minimal required sections for an RFP stub (BLUF, Objective, Scope, Open Questions).
- How `/cloc:rfp` relates to `/cloc:propose`: does rfp produce input that propose later consumes, or are they independent paths to the same doc type?
- Whether rfp stubs should include a `Stories` or `Known Requirements` section to capture user-facing scenarios early.
- Argument handling: should the skill accept a topic string, a reference to an existing doc, or both?

## Known Design Considerations

- RFP stubs use `status: request_for_proposal` and `type: proposal`: they are proposals, just incomplete ones.
- The skill should enforce the subset of sections that make a stub actionable without over-specifying.
- Existing RFP stubs (`nit-fix-skill.md`) use Scope, Open Questions, and domain-specific sections (e.g., Known Convention Targets): the skill should allow optional freeform sections.

## Open Questions

- Should the skill auto-populate tags based on topic keywords, or require the user to supply them?
- Should rfp stubs link to related existing proposals or devlogs?
- What validation (if any) should the PostToolUse hook apply to rfp stubs vs full proposals?
